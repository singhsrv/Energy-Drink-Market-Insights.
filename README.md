# CodeX Energy Drink Market Analysis
## Unlocking Consumer Insights to Drive Business Growth
<p>🏆 Situation: CodeX’s Challenge in a Competitive Market  
As CodeX, a German beverage brand, enters the Indian energy drink market, competition is fierce. Established players dominate retail spaces, and consumer preferences are evolving rapidly toward health-conscious choices.  
To make informed strategic decisions, CodeX needed to understand:  
📌 Who consumes energy drinks? (Demographics)   
📌 What ingredients do consumers prefer? (Product Preferences)    
📌 Where do people buy these drinks? (Retail Behavior)   
📌 Which marketing strategies work best? (Brand Awareness & Positioning)   

A comprehensive survey was conducted across 10 cities, collecting responses from 10,000 participants to uncover trends, preferences, and actionable insights for effective market expansion.  
</p>
<p>🎯 Task: Extracting Actionable Insights from Consumer Data  
The primary goal was to analyze survey responses and transform them into data-driven recommendations for CodeX's marketing, pricing, product development, and expansion strategy. The project focused on:  
✅ Understanding purchasing behaviors across metro and Tier 2 cities  
✅ Identifying consumer expectations for pricing, ingredients, and health benefits  
✅ Evaluating market competitors to determine differentiation strategies  
✅ Assessing brand awareness trends to refine advertising efforts
